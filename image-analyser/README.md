The Unicorn Image Analyser is a web-based tool that allows you to load an image to generate a pixel map and palette for use with Unicorn pixel-art Python files. This documentation provides an overview of how to use the app and its features.

You can download and run this locally, or use the [online demo](https://fotosyn.github.io/UnicornPixelEditor/image-analyser/) here

## Getting Started

To get started with the Unicorn Image Analyser, follow these steps:

1. **Load an Image**: Click on the "Load an image" button and select an image file from your device. The tool will analyze the image and generate pixel data and a color palette.

2. **Image Analysis**: After loading an image, click the "Analyze Image" button to initiate the analysis process. The tool will process the image and provide you with pixel data and a color palette.

3. **Export Data**: You can use the generated pixel data within pixel-art Python files. Click the "Select All" button to select all the generated data, and then click the "Copy to clipboard" button to copy it for use in your Python projects.

## Image Requirements

For best results, it is recommended to use images with the following characteristics:

- **Indexed Palette**: Images with an indexed palette of around 16 to 32 colors are recommended. This helps in generating an easier to manage color palette.

## Supported Unicorn Types and Pixel Sizes

The Unicorn Image Analyser provides pixel sizes for different Unicorn LED matrix types. Here are the supported Unicorn types and their corresponding pixel sizes:

- **Stellar Unicorn**: 16x16 pixels
- **Galactic Unicorn**: 53x11 pixels
- **Cosmic Unicorn**: 32x32 pixels

Refer to the appropriate pixel size when working with your Unicorn LED matrix to ensure the correct rendering of images.
